Time to start putting our data into the machine...

There are two scripts in this repo: `install.sh` and `linux_install.sh`.

If you have a Mac computer:
- cd into this directory once you have forked and cloned it.
  - (When typing `ls` you should see `README.md  install.sh  linux_install.sh`)
- Type `${SHELL} install.sh`
- If you get errors, _do not try to fix them_. Instead, write them down and put them in your pull request. We will fix any errors tomorrow!

If you have a Linux computer:
- Your instructions are about the same except you will run `${SHELL} linux_install.sh`.

That's it! That's all the homework! Take the evening off. We will do much, much more tomorrow!

## ðŸš€ Completion looks like:

- You have either successfully installed postgres or written down any errors that occurred!

## ðŸš€ Your homework submission should include:

- A pull request created on _this repo_.
- A link submitted to the appropriate assignment on [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com/u/0/w/MTI4MTM1MjgyNDYw/t/all).

## This homework is due ðŸš¨ 10AM ON TUESDAY MORNING ðŸš¨
